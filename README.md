# Vue-wiki-countries
This is a Wikipedia of countries builded from a JSOn dataset of countries
Bootstrap V4 is used for the design 👍.

## Components
There are 3 components:

Navbar: Displays the basic navbar with the LAB name.

CountriesList: Displays the list of links with the country names. Each link is a vue-router-dom router-link which we is used to send the country code.

CountryDetails: Is the component that renders via the vue-router's Route and receives the country code via the URL.
